# Record Signature Helper

This document defines the Record Signature Helper resource. 

The Record Signature Helper is a helper endpoint to aid in the creation of [Signature](signatures.html) and [People](people.html) resources via POST. It provides a quick and easy way to create signatures and people at the same time, eliminating the need for multiple POST operations to store that information.

Some systems may attempt to match people sent via the Record Signature Helper to existing people in the database and update their record instead of creating a new person. The method used for matching will be detailed in that system's documentation. 

When using the Record Signature Helper, tagging and list membership info may be added at the same time as well, eliminating the need for multiple POST operations to store that information.

In addition, you can indicate to the server whether to trigger additional actions, such as an autoresponse email sent back to the person who took action.

The response to a Record Signature Helper POST is the full representation of the signature.

Some initial implementations may only support helpers -- direct RESTful access may not be supported. In those cases, the _links section may be omitted in responses.

## Scenarios

{% include scenarios_helper_intro.md %}


### Scenario: Creating a new signature and person (POST)

Posting to the record signature helper endpoint will allow you to create a new signature and person (or update a person if the system attempts to match people posted with helpers) in one operation. The response is the signature that was created. While each implementing system will require different fields, any optional fields not included in a post operation should not be set at all by the receiving system, or should be set to default values.

#### Request

```javascript
