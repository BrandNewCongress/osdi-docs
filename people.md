# Person

This document defines the Person resource. 

People are individual users who are stored in the OSDI system's database in some way.

People have names, email addresses, and other information, and they have associated action histories recording the actions they've taken on the system, such as a list of their signatures on various petitions.

## Endpoints and URL structures

While OSDI does not specify specific endpoints and link structures for compliant systems to use, commonly used conventions are shown below. The links section of each resource or collection, described more fully below, should be your cononical source for the exact URLs pointing to specific other resources or collections.

**Endpoints:**

`https://osdi-sample-system.org/api/v1/people`

People resources live exclusively at the above endpoint. The endpoint returns a collection of all the people in the OSDI system's database associated with the given API key.

**URL Structures:**

`https://osdi-sample-system.org/api/v1/people/[id]`

To address a specific person, use their identifier without the system prefix to construct a URL, like `https://osdi-sample-system.org/api/v1/people/d91b4b2e-ae0e-4cd3-9ed7-d0ec501b0bc3`

## Field names and descriptions

The field names for a person, with standard names, punctuation and capitalization, and values where appropriate. 

**Note:** As with the entire OSDI specification, the specific fields a compliant system implements will vary between each system, as will the fields each system requires when creating or updating resources, which fields are writeable, and the operations you are allowed to perform on each resource.

## Scenario: Creating a new person (POST)

You can create a new person directly by posting to the person signup helper endpoint defined on the AEP and potentially in other places. Systems may also allow you to create new people by posting an action they've taken either on an existing action resource or a new one you create with the API. See the documentation describing each action type (petitions, events, forms, fundraising pages) and each individual action record (signatures, attendance, submissions, donations) for details.

The person signup helper provides a simple method for adding a new person to a collection. It also supports adding tags and list membership info.

The response to a person signup helper post is the full representation of the person that was created.

Some initial implementations may only support helpers, direct RESTful access may not be supported. In those cases, the _links section may be omitted in responses.

When you post to the person signup helper, include a person hash describing the person with the spec defined above, and arrays of strings corresponding to the tags and lists you want to add in the "add_tags" and "add_lists" arrays.

## Scenario: Modifying a person (PUT)

You can updating a person by calling a PUT operation on that person's resource endpoint. Your PUT should contain fields that you want to update. Missing fields will be ignored by the receiving system. Systems may also ignore PUT values, depending on whether fields you are trying to modify are read-only or not. You may set an attribute to nil by including the attribute using `nil` for value.

**Note:** Modifying members of an array separately is not supported. To change the contents of an array, first GET the current contents and then PUT back only those you wish to keep.
