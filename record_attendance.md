# Record Attendance Helper

This document defines the Record Attendance Helper resource. 

The Record Attendance Helper is a helper endpoint to aid in the creation of [Attendance](attendances.html) and [People](people.html) resources via POST. It provides a quick and easy way to create attendances and people at the same time, eliminating the need for multiple POST operations to store that information.

Some systems may attempt to match people sent via the Record Attendance Helper to existing people in the database and update their record instead of creating a new person. The method used for matching will be detailed in that system's documentation. 

When using the Record Attendance Helper, tagging and list membership info may be added at the same time as well, eliminating the need for multiple POST operations to store that information.

The response to a Record Attendance Helper POST is the full representation of the attendance.

Some initial implementations may only support helpers -- direct RESTful access may not be supported. In those cases, the _links section may be omitted in responses.

## Scenarios

### Scenario: Creating a new attendance and person (POST)

Posting to the record attendance helper endpoint will allow you to create a new attendance and person (or update a person if the system attempts to match people posted with helpers) in one operation. The response is the attendance that was created. While each implementing system will require different fields, any optional fields not included in a post operation should not be set at all by the receiving system, or should be set to default values.
