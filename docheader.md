# Note
This file has been created by turning the markdown source into a human friendly format.
This file may be out of date with the current versions in the source repository.
As a result, internal links in the document will not work correctly.
Instead the links documents have been compiled into separate documents

| Document      | Description
|---------------|-----------------------------------------
|protocol.docx  | The compiled protocol files
|scenarios.docx | The compiled scenarios files
|charter.docx   | The compiled charter files
|review.docx    | The compiled review guide files

This document has been compiled with pandoc.  docx is used because the PDF version doesn't get the tables correctly.
The authoritative source for these documents is online at GitHub which is the preferred way for you to view and comment on them
