# Review Guide
## We're looking to know

- Is our charter targeting the right problems?
- Do our goals represent a reasonable solution?
- Are the scenarios we have listed sensible and reflective of the real world?
- What other scenarios do you think are useful?
- What do you think of the hypermedia aspects of this API and the use of HAL?
- Please examine one or more scenarios and then evaluating the technical API details to mentally assess implementation.  If possible, write a quick and dirty implementation against our prototype endpoint.   From that experience we would like to know what challenges they foresee, any suggested changes to the API and what they like about it.
- Please feel free to provide any other feedback.
