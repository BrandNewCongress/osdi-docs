# Lists 
Lists are used to denote collections of resources. A list is a resource type that contains list metadata as well as a link to the items collection. The items collection is the actual list resources.

* Lists are arbitrary: the relationship between a list and a member resource is not based on a query or any other criteria
* Lists are editable: resources may be added to or removed from a list (pending a permission structure determined by the content provider)
* Lists are unique collections of resources: only one instance of a resource may belong to a given list
* Lists are dynamic: every time a list is retrieved, it will return the resources belonging to it at the moment of retrieval
