# Form

This page defines the Form and Submission resources.

Forms are flexible actions for collecting user data. They can be as simple as a signup form collecting an email address on a website to complex surveys that collect lots of questions and answers from users. Forms take submissions, which represent the individual data each time the form was submitted by a user.

Forms make use of but don't encapsulate OSDI [Questions and Answers](questions.html).

## Endpoints and URL structures

While OSDI does not specify specific endpoints and link structures for compliant systems to use, commonly used conventions are shown below. The links section of each resource or collection, described more fully below, should be your canonical source for the exact URLs pointing to specific other resources or collections.

**Endpoints:**

`https://osdi-sample-system.org/api/v1/forms`

Form resources live exclusively at the above endpoint. The endpoint returns a collection of all the forms in the OSDI system's database associated with the given API key.

**URL Structures:**

`https://osdi-sample-system.org/api/v1/forms/[id]`

To address a specific form, use their identifier without the system prefix to construct a URL, like `https://osdi-sample-system.org/api/v1/form/d91b4b2e-ae0e-4cd3-9ed7-d0ec501b0bc3`

Forms have submissions, and so thos submissions can be retreived like so:
`https://osdi-sample-system.org/api/v1/form/d91b4b2e-ae0e-4cd3-9ed7-d0ec501b0bc3/submissions`

A specific submissions is as follows:
`https://osdi-sample-system.org/api/v1/form/d91b4b2e-ae0e-4cd3-9ed7-d0ec501b0bc3/submissions/7fj23fds-3sf1-fds3-asj9-832mkdsoie81`

## Field names and descriptions

The field names for a form and submission, with standard names, punctuation and capitalization, and values where appropriate. 

**Note:** As with the entire OSDI specification, the specific fields a compliant system implements will vary between each system, as will the fields each system requires when creating or updating resources, which fields are writeable, and the operations you are allowed to perform on each resource.

## Links

The links associated with this person, available in the links section of the resource. 

**Note:** As with the entire OSDI specification, the specific links a compliant system supplies will vary between each system. In addition, systems may choose to embed a linked resource directly in the response in addition to linking to it in the links section, using the standard `_embedded` syntax described in the general overview documentation.

|Name          |Description
|-----------    |--------------
|submissions      |A link to the collection of form submissions associated with the form.
|question_answers |A link to the collection of question-answer pairs associated with the form.

## Scenario: Retreiving a collection of form resources (GET)

## Default embed policy

When retreiving a form resource, the creator can be embedded, but the submissions collection should only be linked.

When retreiving a submission or list of submissions, the person, the form related to the submission, and the related question answers can be embedded.

## Scenario: Creating a new form (POST)

Posting to the forms collection endpoint will allow you to create a new form. The response is the new form that was created. While each implementing system will require different fields, any optional fields not included in a post operation should not be set at all by the receiving system, or should be set to default values.

**Request**

```javascript
POST https://osdi-sample-system.org/api/v1/people/

Header:
OSDI-API-Token:[your api key here]

{
  "identifiers": [
      "foreign_system:1"
  ],
  "summary": "Take our year-end activist survey",
  "description": "<p>Please take this survey to tell us stuff about you.</p>",
  "call_to_action": "Take our survey",
  "browser_url": "https://api.opensupporter.org/forms/take-our-year-end-activist-survey"  
}
```

**Response**

```javascript
200 OK

Content-Type: application/hal+json
Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate

{
  "identifiers": [
    "osdi_sample_system:d91b4b2e-ae0e-4cd3-9ed7-de9uemdse",
    "foreign_system:1"
  ],
  "created_date": "2014-03-20T21:04:31Z",
  "modified_date": "2014-03-20T21:04:31Z",

      "href": "https://osdi-sample-system.org/api/v1/forms/d91b4b2e-ae0e-4cd3-9ed7-de9uemdse"
    },
    "osdi:submissions": {
      "href": "https://osdi-sample-system.org/api/v1/forms/d91b4b2e-ae0e-4cd3-9ed7-de9uemdse/submissions"
    },
  }
}
```

## Scenario: Modifying a form (PUT)

You can updating a form by calling a PUT operation on that form's resource endpoint. Your PUT should contain fields that you want to update. Missing fields will be ignored by the receiving system. Systems may also ignore PUT values, depending on whether fields you are trying to modify are read-only or not. You may set an attribute to nil by including the attribute using `nil` for value.

**Note:** Modifying members of an array separately is not supported. To change the contents of an array, first GET the current contents and then PUT back only those you wish to keep.

**Request**

```javascript
PUT https://osdi-sample-system.org/api/v1/forms/d91b4b2e-ae0e-4cd3-9ed7-de9uemdse

Header:
OSDI-API-Token:[your api key here]

{
    "summary": "Take our new year-end activist and supporter survey"
}

```

**Response**

```javascript
200 OK

Content-Type: application/hal+json
Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate

{
  "identifiers": [
    "osdi_sample_system:d91b4b2e-ae0e-4cd3-9ed7-de9uemdse",
    "foreign_system:1"
