# Queries
A query is a collection of resources that fit a set of criteria.

* Queries are nonarbitrary: a resource's inclusion in the collection is based on attributes intrinsic to that resource
* Queries may only be dynamic: A dynamic query will return the resources which match its criteria at the moment the query is retrieved. To implement a static query, which contains the resources which matched its criteria at the time the query was created, the API's [list object](lists.md) object may be used.
* Queries may only be created, deleted and edited on the content provider's native system; OSDI does not support CRUD operations on queries
* Query metadata may be updated via the API, but query criteria may only be modified and queries may only be created or deleted via the content provider's system
* Queries are unique collections of resources: a resource may match a query only once

| name 	| type	| description	|
|-------|-------|---------------|
| identifiers | Identifier[] | An array of identifiers
| description	| string	| description of the query's function; if possible, enough data to recreate query on the host system	|
| created_date	| timestamp	| time the query was created	|
| origin_system | string    | Human readable identifier of the system where this query was created
| name		| string	| name of the query	|
| total_results	| integer	| number of results in the query	|
| osdi_results | []*	 | the collection of resources which match the query's criteria at the time of the query's creation in static queries or at the time of retrieval in dynamic queries	|

# Results
A result is an individual member of a query, linked to a resource type such as a person. A result can be of any resource type. Results are unique within their query.

**Note:** Because results represent the actual results of a query in real time, resources that results link to will not display a link back to a collection of results that link to that resource. This is done to protect system resources. For example, a person resource will not have a link to a collection of results that link to that person, as this would easily cause high server load as the system re-runs all queries to determine which queries that person matches at that moment.

| result_type     | string      | the type of result, eg "osdi:person"
