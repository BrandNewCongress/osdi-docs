# Queries
A query is a collection of resources that fit a set of criteria

* Queries are nonarbitrary: a resource's inclusion in the collection is based on attributes intrinsic to that resource
* Queries may only be dynamic: A dynamic query will return the resources which match its criteria at the moment the query is retrieved. To implement a static query, which contains the resources which matched its criteria at the time the query was created, the API's list object may be used.
* Queries may only be created, deleted and edited on the content provider's native system; OSDI does not support CRUD operations on queries
* Query metadata may be updated via the API, but query criteria may only be modified and queries may only be created or deleted via the content provider's system
* Queries are unique collections of resources: a resource may match a query only once

| name 	| type	| description	|
|-------|-------|---------------|
| identifiers | Identifier[] | An array of identifiers
| description	| string	| description of the query's function; if possible, enough data to recreate query on the host system	|
| created_date	| timestamp	| time the query was created	|
| item_type     | string      | the type of item, eg "osdi:person"
| origin_system | string    | Human readable identifier of the system where this query was created
| name		| string	| name of the query	|
| total_items	| integer	| number of items in the query	|
| osdi_items | []*	 | the collection of resources which match the query's criteria at the time of the query's creation in static queries or at the time of retrieval in dynamic queries	|
